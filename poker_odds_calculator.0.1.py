#Pot Odds Calculator
#Autor: Marc Leon
#Python 3.7.3

#This program will calculate your pot odds.
#To end the program, enter the number 0.00

#window.title("Pot Odds Calculator")
#example. There are 10 BB in the pot. Someone bets 5 BB. Now there are 15BB in the pot.
#program asks What is new the pot size? This means you can only put the pot size in after the last bet.
#program takes your pot odds and converts them into your equity percentage.
# suppose your required equity is 25%.
# You're on the flop with 10 outs. multiply your outs by 2 and you determine you need 20% equity to call
# according to your immediate odds, you should fold, but you can probably make more than the 20% if you hit your hand
#Youâ€™re on the flop with 10 outs. Villain goes all in. Your equity required is 25% you have about a 40% chance of hitting
#you should call
#The point of this program is not to use it in a live game, but I wrote it to think through the logic of basic poker math.
#For the record, it is not that difficult to do this math in your head, but writing the code helps me understand the logic.
#I am also using it as a framework to learn some things in python like GUI.
